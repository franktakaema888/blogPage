#### Getting started with my project

Edit this section to include any settings that should be adjusted in configuration files and concise instructions for how to access the reader and author pages once the app is running.

NB. we will ONLY run `npm install`, `npm run build-db`, and `npm run start` . We will NOT install additional packages to run your code and will NOT run additional build scripts. Be careful with any additional node dependencies that you use.
